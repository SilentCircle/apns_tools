# APNS Tools

This repository contains scripts to assist with testing APNS clients.

The tools currently provided are described below.

## Fake Apple Certificates

`fake_apple_certs.sh` will generate

- A fake Apple Root CA certificate and private key
- A fake Apple Worldwide Developer Relations CA certificate and private key
- A fake Apple intermediate certificate (ISTCA2G1) and private key
- A fake Apple api.push.apple.com production server certificate and private key
- A fake Apple api.development.push.apple.com development server certificate
  and private key
- A chain file for the fake WWDR CA certificate, consisting of the fake root
  and the fake WWDR CA certificate
- A chain file for the fake ISTCA2G1 certificate, consisting of the fake root
  and the fake ISTCA2G1 CA certificate
- A fake VoIP client certificate and private key for com.example.FakeApp.

These attempt to duplicate the real Apple certificates as closely as possible,
obviously with different serial numbers, public keys, and Subject Key
Identifiers and Authority Key Identifiers.

The purpose of these certs is to create fake Apple Push certificates for use in
an APNS simulation environment. The simulation environment would need to
provide the fake Apple WWDR chain file to any test clients, and serve the
ISTCA2G1 chain file along with the server cert on the simulation server.

### File locations

The directory tree containing the certificates looks like this:

    CA
    |- certs/FakeAppleCA.cert.pem
    |- private/FakeAppleCA.key.unencrypted.pem
    |- ISTCA2G1
    |  | - FakeAppleISTCA2G1.csr
    |  | - certs/FakeAppleDevPushServer.cert.pem
    |  | - certs/FakeAppleISTCA2G1.cert.pem
    |  | - certs/FakeAppleISTCA2G1.chain.cert.pem
    |  | - certs/FakeAppleProdPushServer.cert.pem
    |  | - private/FakeAppleDevPushServer.key.unencrypted.pem
    |  | - private/FakeAppleISTCA2G1.key.unencrypted.pem
    |  | - private/FakeAppleProdPushServer.key.unencrypted.pem
    |- WWDRCA
    |  | - FakeAppleWWDRCA.csr
    |  | - com.example.FakeApp.universal.csr
    |  | - com.example.FakeApp.voip.csr
    |  | - certs/FakeAppleWWDRCA.chain.cert.pem
    |  | - certs/FakeAppleWWDRCA.cert.pem
    |  | - certs/com.example.FakeApp.universal.cert.pem
    |  | - certs/com.example.FakeApp.voip.cert.pem
    |  | - private/FakeAppleWWDRCA.key.unencrypted.pem
    |  | - private/com.example.FakeApp.universal.key.unencrypted.pem
    |  | - private/com.example.FakeApp.voip.key.unencrypted.pem



The entire tree may be deleted. It will be regenerated by the script; note that
some details of the certificates and keys will change due to the random key
generation and the deletion of the serial and index files.

### Deviations

The Apple push server certificates are issued by the ISTCA2G1 certificate.  The
real ISTCA2G1 CA certificate is issued by GeoTrust. Obviously, we can't issue
the fake certificate from GeoTrust unless we make a fake one of those, too,
which seems unnecessarily burdensome.  To mitigate this, the issuer for the fake
ISTCA2G1 CA certificate is the fake Apple Root CA.

## TODO

- Add generation of fake APNS client certificates for
  - enterprise development/production
  - (optionally) Apple Watch, Mac Push, others
